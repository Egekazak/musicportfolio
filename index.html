        <p>I produced, recorded, arranged, mixed, and co-wrote this demo. Bergita provided vocals and collaborated with me on the lyrics. Her humming, mumbled melodies, and instinctive phrasing helped shape the lyrics quickly, making the writing process feel natural and intuitive.</p>

        <p>On this record, I aimed to push Drew out of his comfort zone and into a more modern pop sound. I handled the production, arrangement, and mixing, while Drew recorded his vocals and wrote the lyrics independently, guided by my creative direction. Although we worked remotely from different continents, the process went smoothly. Thanks to Drew‚Äôs talent and strong intuition, he immediately understood the vision, and we wrapped the track faster than expected.</p>
